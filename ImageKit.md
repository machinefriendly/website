MULTIPLE IMAGES DIRECT INSERT TO CELL, BYEBYE FORMULA!
You don’t have to insert images one-by-one. Instead we enable you to insert multiple images at the same time. Efficiency achieved!

Pick image from multiple sources
No matter where your images are, you pick them easily.

We have an easy to use URL input box that you can use to insert several images at once.Don't know how to get the web image's URL address? Check [this](https://www.machinefriendly.com/gsuite-google-spreadsheet-addon-imagekit#faq-howtogetimgurlhttps://www.machinefriendly.com/gsuite-google-spreadsheet-addon-imagekit#faq-howtogetimgurl).

You may also pick images from you computer, your Google Drive, and Google Image Search.

smart URL
For certain, popular websites and their image pages, you don't need take time looking for image URLs- Just use that page URL directly.

This could be super convenient for some web based screenshot services, such as [Cloudapp](https://www.getcloudapp.com/), Droplr and Lightshot. They automatically copy the image PAGE URL to your clipboard, and the only thing you have to do is to paste that URL into ImageKit. ImageKit can then find and insert the correct image.

Please find this screenshot video showing you how ImageKit works with Cloudapp.

personalized layout
It was not easy to arrange multiple images’ layout order in Google Sheets™, but now you can configure the output layout and images will appear in the order that you want them to.
The add-on will remind you about the layout once you select multiple images to insert.

 

Google workspace ADMIN SETTING
