<h1 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">MachineFriendly Terms of Service</h1>

<p>Welcome to MachineFriendly. These Terms of Service (the "Terms") are a binding legal agreement between you and MachineFriendly Oy ("MachineFriendly" or "we," "our" or "us" ), regarding your use of our websites (MachineFriendly.com), our software and services (the websites, software and services are collectively referred to as the "Service").</p>

<p>Please read these Terms carefully. The term "you" shall also include your employees or other authorised users to the extent applicable and permitted under your subscription of the Service.</p>

<p>By creating an account with MachineFriendly, you agree to be bound by the Terms and Policies (as defined below) and become a party to this agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this agreement, do not create your account and stop using the Service immediately.</p>

<p>In addition, when using certain features of the Service you also may be subject to the guidelines, terms, and agreements applicable to such features ("Policies"). All such Policies are incorporated by reference into these Terms. If these Terms are inconsistent with any Policy, the terms in the Policy will control.</p>

<p>We may periodically make changes to these Terms and Policies or introduce new provisions, terms or conditions governing the use of the Service. We will notify registered users of changes by posting updates to <a href="http://www.supermetrics.com/">www.MachineFriendly.com</a> and/or by email.</p>

<p>By using the Service, you accept these Terms and Policies and any modifications that we may make to these Terms and Policies from time to time. It is your responsibility to review the most recent version of the Terms and Policies frequently and remain informed of any changes to it.</p>

<p>If you continue to use the Service after we modify the Terms and Policies, you will be deemed to have consented to such modified terms for your use of the Service as of the date of the modification. If you do not agree to any provision of these Terms or Policies, you must not use the Service.</p>

<p><strong>1. The Service</strong></p>

<p>The Service is an analytics and reporting solution that helps marketers collect social media and online marketing data and create reports in Excel, Google Drive and online.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>2. Eligibility</strong></p>

<p>The Service is not intended for users that are consumers (being an individual acting primarily for purposes other than a trade, business or profession) and the applicability of consumer protection legislation is therefore excluded. You must be 18 years of age or older to enter into this agreement and use the Service. You represent and warrant that any information you submit is true and accurate and that you are 18 years of age or older and are fully able and competent to enter into, and abide by these Terms.</p>

<p><strong>3. Account Registration</strong></p>

<p>You must register to use certain features of the Services. When you register, you agree to (a) provide accurate, current and complete information about you as may be prompted by registration forms on the Service ("Registration Data"); (b) maintain the security of any logins, passwords, or other credentials that you select or that are provided to you for use on the Service; (c) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data, and any other information you provide to us, and to keep all such information accurate, current, and complete; and (d) notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security by emailing us at update@MachineFriendly.com.</p>

<p><strong>4. Free Trial</strong></p>

<p>We may at our sole discretion offer you free trials for selected features of the Service or a limited time trial period of the entire Service. Once your free trial period ends, your ability to access the Service will terminate. MachineFriendly reserves the right to determine if you are eligible for a free trial and to discontinue any free trial without notice at our sole discretion.</p>

<p><strong>5. Fees; No Refunds</strong></p>

<p>Access to selected features of the Service may be provided to you free of charge. We will charge fees for certain features, either on a one-time or a subscription basis ("Paid Services"). MachineFriendly reserves the right to implement fees or change the fees for certain services at any time by providing you notice on the Service or otherwise.</p>

<p>When you purchase any Paid Services, you authorize MachineFriendly or its third party payment processors to charge the credit card identified by you (which you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use) all applicable fees for your purchase, including all applicable taxes, and you agree that our payment provider can store your credit card information.</p>

<p>If MachineFriendly does not receive payment from your credit card provider, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand and MachineFriendly may suspend your access to the Services until full payment is received. All sales are final and MachineFriendly will not issue refunds, including for prepaid monthly fees.</p>

<p>If you choose an automatic recurring payment and later decide to end your subscription, cancelling the payment is your responsibility. MachineFriendly does not refund automatic payments not cancelled in time.</p>

<p><strong>6. Use Restrictions</strong></p>

<p>Your right to use the Service is personal, limited to your internal business purposes and the purpose set out in section 1 above, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable and subject to your compliance with the Terms and Policies at all times, including your timely payment of all applicable fees for Paid Services.</p>

<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you will not: (a) access, monitor, or copy any content or information on the Service using any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means or any manual process for any purpose without our express written permission; (b) violate the restrictions in any robot exclusion headers on the Service or bypass or circumvent other measures employed to prevent or limit access to the Service; (c) take any action that imposes, or may impose, in our discretion, an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (d) deep-link to any portion of the Service for any purpose without our express written permission; (e) "frame", "mirror," or otherwise incorporate any part of the Service into any other website without our prior written authorization; or (f) intentionally or unintentionally violate any applicable local, provincial national, or international law or regulation.</p>

<p>The Service allows you to gather data from multiple third-party data sources and services, including various third-party websites.

<p><strong>15. Disclaimer of Warranties</strong></p>

<p>Your use of the service, including, without limitation, your use of any content accessible through the service and your interactions and dealings with any service users, is at your sole risk. The service, and all content available on and through the service are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. MachineFriendly and its suppliers and licensors expressly disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. MachineFriendly does not warrant uninterrupted use or operation of the service or your access to any content. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from the service will create any warranty regarding MachineFriendly that is not expressly stated in these terms.</p>

<p>Neither MachineFriendly nor its suppliers or licensors will be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses (even if MachineFriendly or any supplier or licensor has been advised of the possibility of these damages), arising out of or relating to your access to or use of, or your inability to access or use, the Service or any content.</p>

<p>The maximum total liability of MachineFriendly and its suppliers and licensors to you for all claims under these Terms or otherwise in relation to the Service, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, is EUR 100. Each provision of these terms that provides for a limitation of liability, disclaimer of warranties, or exclusion of damages is to allocate the risks under these terms between the parties. This allocation is an essential element of the basis of the bargain between the parties. Each of these provisions is severable and independent of all other provisions of these terms. The limitations in this section will apply even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>

<p><strong>17. Consent to Electronic Communications</strong></p>

<p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Finland, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law or to the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach, termination or validity thereof, shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Finland Chamber of Commerce. The seat of arbitration shall be Helsinki, Finland. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The language of the arbitration shall be Finnish.</p>

<p><strong>19 .Other terms</strong></p>

<p>Our failure to act in a particular circumstance does not waive our ability to act with respect to that circumstance or similar circumstances. Any provision of these Terms that is found to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable will be severed from these Terms, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue to be in full force and effect.</p>

<p>The section headings and titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>

<p>Any provision in these Terms that by its nature should survive the termination of your license to access the Service or any termination of these Terms (including, without limitation, provisions governing indemnification, limitations on liability, disclaimers of warranty, and ownership of intellectual property) will continue to remain in full force and effect after any such termination.</p>

<p>These Terms, including all Policies, constitute the entire agreement between you and MachineFriendly concerning the Service. These Terms supersede all prior agreements or communications between you and MachineFriendly regarding the subject matter of these Terms.</p>
